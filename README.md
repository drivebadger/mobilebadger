# Overview

Mobile Badger is a mobile version of [Drive Badger](https://github.com/drivebadger/drivebadger), meant to exfiltrate data from:

- mobile devices (all brands and models that connect to the computer using USB, and support either MTP or PTP protocol for transferring data)
- external drives (eg. pulled from computers, where standard Drive Badger cannot be run, because [all USB ports are damaged](https://github.com/drivebadger/drivebadger/wiki/Hardware-problems-(damaged-USB-ports)))

This is however an empty repository. Mobile Badger and Drive Badger shares the same code repository, and [this one](https://github.com/drivebadger/mobilebadger/wiki) is made only for separate Wiki.
